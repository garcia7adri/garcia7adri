👋 Hi, I’m Adriana García!

I am Data Scientist who is interested in improving processes through insights coming from well-processed data. 
I've found data is a valuable source of information if handled using the right tools. My tools so far are Python and its libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn, as well as, SQL. As I am a life-long learner, I keep improving my skills and methods in this field.😉

Also, I am a Machine Learning enthusiast. I've enrolled in Algebra and Calculus courses in order to deepen my knowledge. This field is so interesting and attiring that I would like to join and contribute to its expansion.

📈 Regarding my work experience, my principal industries are Translation and Marketing, I can give insightful remarks about them.
My main interests are finance industry, Natural Language Processing or any other field that can bring good to society. I am open to learn about a new industry and work hard for the team goals.

PS: I am polyglot, I speak Spanish (mother tounge), English, French, Portuguese and a bit of Mandarin Chinese.
